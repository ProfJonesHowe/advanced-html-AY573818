			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I was born and raised in Ukraine and moved to the U.S. a little over a decade ago. I studied Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity at Mohawk Valley Community College and have always loved learning about technology, languages, and different cultures. I also work as a translator and interpreter for English, Russian, and Ukrainian, which lets me connect with people who have recently arrived in the US. In my free time, I enjoy traveling with my girlfriend; we've got to experience five different countries in the last three years! Also, going to concerts while in different cities and even countries is definitely a must in my book! </p>
